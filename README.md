# LimaAirQuality

This provides a simple script, air_analysis.py, that generates boxplots of air quality at the US Embassy in Lima Peru to help people in Lima decide what dates and times usually have cleaner air, and when precautions should usually be taken to avoid health issues.

The data needed to run the scripts and re-generate the plots is found here https://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.global_summary#Peru$Lima
